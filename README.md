Experimental software to apply tedius fixes to large Rust programs.

Please run this program on a tree that DOES NOT have work you can't afford to
lose. Project VCS must be git for the software to function, be built in the
normal way with `cargo`.

## Acknowledgments

This software was inspired by
[cargo-mutants](https://github.com/sourcefrog/cargo-mutants) and I have used
parts of that software here with modifications. Thank you to Martin Pool for
their work.
